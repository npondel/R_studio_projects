### Culminating Project Code Suppliment

Hello!  This is the code suppliment to my MPH culminating project.  This code is intended to be an example of the way various project steps were coded and ran.  It was written for a specific dataset, and while it is not "plug and play" for other analysis uses it could be cloned and modified to fit another dataset.

R code can be browsed here in it's plain text form.  In order to view and run the code natively, you need to install the [R base software](https://www.r-project.org/) and will likely want to use [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as well.


### String Matching File Naming Instructions
1. Text data file must be named "text_data.csv" with columns "KEY_CASE" and "all_fields".
2. Word variables file must be named "word_vars".  Word variable file must be an excel file with sheets for each variable and a single column of words in the A column.
3. Bigrams and Trigrams must be seperated by either a space " " or an underscore "\_" in order to be matched properly.
